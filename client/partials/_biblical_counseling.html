<p>

Biblical Counseling involves understanding the problems of living in this fallen world while

offering practical solutions from the perspective of scripture. The Bible is used both to

define the problems and to develop methods for solving them. I have my Master of Arts

from Trinity Theological Seminary and am currently concluding the certification process

through the Association of Certified Biblical Counselors, hence I am not a licensed

psychologist.
